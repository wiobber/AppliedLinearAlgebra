\begin{problem}

  Load the matrix \texttt{mod1mat.mat} from the course files and fill in the following blanks:
  
  \item The matrix \texttt{mod1mat} has dimensions $\answer{123}\times \answer{541}$.
  \item The $(1,1)$-entry of \texttt{mod1mat} is $\answer{20}$.
  \item The $(57,342)$-entry of $3\cdot\texttt{mod1mat}$ is $\answer{57}$.
  \item The sum of the entries in the 98th row of \texttt{mod1mat} is $\answer{5437}$.
  \item The $(100,512)$-entry of $\texttt{mod1mat}/2$ is $\answer{2}$.
  
  \begin{hint}
  
    Make sure you're working in a folder that includes the +mod1 course folder, then load the matrix.
\begin{verbatim}
  load +mod1/mod1mat.mat
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{size} command gives the dimensions, and the $(i,j)$-entry of a matrix $A$ is given by \texttt{A(i,j)}.

\end{hint}
